     - Individualism: Pinker
       - No better alternative to individualism
       - Steve Jobs might agree since the `user-experience` dominated his thinking
       - As contrasted with Fortune 500 CIOs as a mediator between users & producers of computers
     - Socialism: Mearsheimer
       - Fundamentally competitive species
         - Tribal
         - National
         - Mearsheimers reminds us of Frank Fukuyama's "end of history" case at end of the 1980s
           - Pinker is optimistic in the same way just only 30 years later
           - Fukuyama feared only bored where there's no more contests
           - Obama and Clinton called politics a `contact sport`
           - It's rather that the limits of reason guarantee that we'll remain human, all-too-human
